# Whack-A-Mole

## Description
Whack-A-Mole is a game which consists of moles popping out of holes once at a time randomly and you have to click on each mole to score a point. The win/lose condition is that with every game there will be specific time and a number of moles that will pop out of each hole as long as the timer runs, if you hit 70% or more of the moles, you'll win otherwise, you'll lose.

## How to Get Started
At first, we plan out and write down the to-do list in [Trello](https://trello.com/b/cWuKVxPa/my-trello-board), after that we create the layout of how we want the app to looklike on [Draw.io](https://www.drawio.com/). After that we write down the pseudocode and break down the tasks as much as possible going into detail so we can easily turn the broken down points into code.

The next step is creating the repository and adding the html, css, js and README files inside of the project directory. Starting with the HTML file, we add the boilerplate and link the other files with each other.

The last step is walking through the pseudocode and code each line while testing and troubleshooting along the way until the game is finalized.

## Credits
For the credits, I used [DeepSeek](https://www.deepseek.com/en) to generate ideas for the browser game to choose one and I'm going to use [Whack-A-Mole](https://whack-a-mole-js.netlify.app/) as a reference and inspiration.

## Pseudocode
```javascript
// 1. Initialize DOM elements and game states

// 2. Randomly make the mole appear and disappear while playing

// 3. Handle the whacks and scoring

// 4. Include reset, timer, start game controls and loop the game

// 5. Add the necessary event listeners like the start button
```
